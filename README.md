# **Forecasting**

## Model Selection
I wanted to use a Convolutional Neural Network to predict 5 years out of sample and compare the results to a random forest regressor and analyst estimates. 
The random forest model would predict one year into the future, using a one year lag in the data's explanatory variables. 


## Results
The random forest regressor predicted 2021 revenue of $5202.\
The CNN model predicted revenue of $7518.\
The analysts predict around $8320.\
*\*all figures are in millions*
